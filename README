This repo is a culmulation of information from a variety of sources in my machine learning exploration. 

The data is originally from the open data available through Unicef (https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/), I spent a
large portion of the time devoted to this project, sorting through the data (as explained in my summary).

The scrubbed and modified data will be attached in this repo for others to use, I got rid of all data not related to infant mortality rate
and changed it from organization by country, to organization by geographical area.

Additionally, a lot of the information, ideas, etc. for this project came from a presentation by Susan Ibach (hockeygeekgirl on Github)
and her intro to machine learning repo.

Finally, I am just a high school student, and this project did not turn out as I had hoped in terms of actually predicting anything,
the margins of errors are very large and should not be used as an accurate predictor. Despite this, it was a valuable learning opportuiny 
which is why I am publishing it.
